# peer-up Unified Configuration
#
# This config works for all peerup modes (daemon, proxy, ping).
# Run "peerup init" to generate this file interactively.
#
# Config search order:
#   1. --config flag (if given)
#   2. ./peerup.yaml (current directory)
#   3. ~/.config/peerup/config.yaml
#   4. /etc/peerup/config.yaml

# Config schema version (do not change manually)
version: 1

identity:
  # Path to the key file for persistent peer identity
  # Relative paths are resolved from the config file's directory
  key_file: "identity.key"

network:
  # Addresses to listen on for incoming connections
  # Port 0 = ephemeral (OS-assigned), good for clients
  # Fixed port (e.g., 9100) is better for servers
